[Spatial Shoes - VDP 2024](https://github.com/TheHandyOwl/SpatialShoesVDP2024)

# Project

This is the practice for the Visual Development Program 2024.

We have to build a 3D environment of a sneaker showcase.

Disclaimer: Sorry, I don't own an Apple Vision Pro. I have no way to test the immersive space part.

## Tasks to be performed:

- Create a catalogue that shows all the information and models.
- The models can be manipulated in 3D so that they can be viewed from any orientation and size in a “free” viewing mode.
- There will also be a “view” mode that can be chosen on screen so that the model rotates continuously and automatically.
- You can click on a 3D model to see it in a volumetric window exclusively and with more detail.
- You can mark any of the models as a favorite.
- A new layout will be generated for these favorites in shelf mode where you can see the 3D models rotating continuously with their name below and clicking on it will show its file in more detail.
- An immersive space will be created where there will be a shoe carousel. The first one will appear in front of us with some next or previous buttons, which will make the others appear. You can create this by having them move in and out of the screen by opacity (for example) or even on a wheel where you can see the others as they approach. The way you present this space is free. But they have to be able to be seen in as much detail as possible while we have it "held" and when we release it, it will return to its position in the sample space.
